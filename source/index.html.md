# Introduction

Welcome to the Madefire API! You can use our API to access our [motionbook](http://www.madefire.com/motion-books/) resources.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

All API requests are made to the `https://api.madefire.com/` hostname.
